# Regression-Techniques
 
 
 The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.

Dataset:
Use the California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices.

Key Components  Fulfilled:

Loading and Preprocessing 


Loaded the California Housing dataset using the fetch_california_housing function from sklearn.

Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.

Handled missing values  and performed necessary feature scaling using standardization
Capped Outliers using IQR



Regression Algorithm Implementation 

Implemented the following regression algorithms:


Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Model Evaluation and Comparison 

Evaluated the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)
